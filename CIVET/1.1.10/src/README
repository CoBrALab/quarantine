CIVET 1.1.10 Install Instructions
=================================

0. Install build dependencies: 
  - automake
  - autoconf
  - libtool
  - libblas-dev
  - liblapack-dev
  - libnetpbm9-dev

1. Obtain the CIVET source code (`civet-1.1.10.tgz`) and unpack it. 

2. Place netpbm-10.35.87.tgz tarball in the TGZ folder, e.g.

    wget --continue -O TGZ/netpbm-10.35.87.tgz  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/netpbm/netpbm-10.35.87.tgz

This is done because CIVET 1.1.10 depends on, but doesn't build, netpbm (unlike
CIVET 1.1.12, which does).  

3. Note that following modifications have been made to build CIVET:

  - `src/Makefile` builds netpbm (bits for that stolen directly from CIVET
    1.1.12)

4. Set the INSTALL_DIR location in `src/install.sh`

5. Build by running `install.sh`
