CIVET (cortical thickness analysis)
-----------------------------------

The CIVET tool builds on the MINC toolkit to create a pipeline for cortical
thickness analysis. You will need our permission and permission from the authors
in order to use this tool.

Note, to run CIVET on the SciNET GPC queue, you must not run it in 'granular'
mode, but instead run it as a single pipeline for each of your subjects. You can
then 8-16 of these commands in parallel on a node.  

I've added a few scripts to make life using CIVET a little easier. 

  - civet_rename_inputs: renames input files to meet the CIVET naming
                         conventions. Run with the --help option for more info.

  - civet_run_template:  a template script you can copy into your project and
                         modify to meet your needs. This script takes care of
                         generating a list of IDs needed by CIVET before it can
                         be run.

  - civet_init:          If you just want to get started quickly, run this
                         command. It assumes you have renamed your files
                         correnctly, and have them in a folder named ./input. 
                         It produces a list of commands to run CIVET on each of
                         your subjects, which you can now submit to the Scinet
                         queue (this script will output the command to do that).

  - qbatch:              Given a file that lists one command per line, this
                         script submits batches of commands to the GPC queue for
                         a specified walltime. You can also configure how many
                         processes are run simultaneously from each batch on a
                         node (by default, 8, but because of hyperthreading if
                         you aren't using much memory, you can use up to 16).
