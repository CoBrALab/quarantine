CIVET 1.1.12 Install Instructions
=================================

1. Obtain the CIVET source code (`civet-1.1.12-cdrom.tar`) and unpack it. 
2. Place EBTKS toolkit version 1.6.30 tarball in the TGZ folder, e.g.

    wget --continue -O TGZ/ebtks-1.6.30.tar.gz https://github.com/BIC-MNI/EBTKS/archive/release-1.6.30.tar.gz

This is done because the version of EBTKS that ships with CIVET does not build
correctly with GCC 4.4. 

3. Note that following modifications have been made to build CIVET 1.1.12:

  - `src/install.sh` does not build the `imagemagick` or `visual` targets
  - `src/Makefile` builds the 1.6.30 version of EBTKS

4. Set the INSTALL_DIR location in `src/install.sh`
5. Build by running `install.sh`
